# About
This is a simple demonstration app to show the use of Electron.js in running a Three.js application, as well as how it would be distributed and run in production.
# Using the Repository
### Setting Things Up
The only thing you should need to do before running the program is a simple *npm install*, which will install all of the node modules and create the folder to store them in. Also not committed to the repository are any model files, so make sure to add any you would like to preview to the folder located in *./app/models/*.
### To Run the Program
To run the program, it is as easy as doing *npm start*. If you want to run it from an executable, you can do *npm run build* which will create an *out* folder which will have the different program files sorted by operating system.
